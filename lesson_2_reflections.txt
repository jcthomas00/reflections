What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When initializing a repository, git
sets everything up to perform version
control. It doesn't create a commit
until you type git status. This is
needed for git to start tracking 
changes. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place to put
all the files in the working
directory that are going to be part
of the next commit. It gives the 
user granular control on each commit
state.
